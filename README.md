# Home Assistant Blueprints Collection

This repository contains a collection of well-documented, production-ready blueprints for Home Assistant automation.

## About Home Assistant & Blueprints

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an amazing home automation platform that gives you full control over all your smart devices and allows you to integrate different platforms seamlessly.

[Blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/) are reusable automation templates that make it easy to share and implement complex automations without starting from scratch.
